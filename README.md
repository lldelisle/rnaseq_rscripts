# rnaseq_rscripts
Rscripts with config files to analyse/plot RNAseq data. Each R scripts which begins with 'step' can either be sourced from RStudio or launched in commandline mode: `Rscript step...`. Each of this script require a config file.

I suggest you to clone the whole repository to get access to all scripts and examples of config files.

A full documentation is available [here](./docs/Documentation.md)

An example of analysis is available [here](./docs/ExampleStepByStep.md) where you can see examples of plots you can get.

If you directly want to start your analysis go [here](./docs/Start.md).
